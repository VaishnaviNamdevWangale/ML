🔥 Importing and Installing Numpy
Install numpy (pip install numpy).
Import it (import numpy as np).
Check its version (np.__version__).

📥 Array Creation
Created arrays using np.array().
Created from both lists and tuples.

📐 Dimensions
Created arrays of:
0-D, 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D.
Checked the number of dimensions using .ndim.

🗂️ Accessing Elements
Accessing elements by index.
Accessing elements from 2-D and 3-D arrays.
Negative indexing.

✂️ Slicing
Simple and advanced slicing (arr[0:5], arr[-4:-1]).
Slicing with steps (arr[0:10:2]).
Negative slicing.

🔍 Data Types
Checked data types (arr.dtype).
Converted data types (arr.astype(int)).

📏 Reshaping Arrays
Checked array shape and size (arr.shape, arr.size).
Reshaped array using arr.reshape().

♻️ Iteration and Joining
Iteration over array elements.
Concatenate multiple arrays (np.concatenate()).

✂️ Splitting, Searching, and Sorting
Split array using np.array_split().
Checked existence (arr == value).
Sorted array in ascending and descending order (np.sort()).

🩺 Filtering
Created boolean masks for filtering.
Created filter array using conditions.

➕ Adding and Removing Elements
Appended elements (np.append()).
Inserted elements (np.insert()).
Deleted elements (np.delete()).

📊 Aggregating and Statistical Functions
Aggregation: sum(), min(), max(), cumsum().
Statistical calculations:
Mean (np.mean()),
Median (np.median()),
Mode (stats.mode())

⚡️ Usage
Install required packages:
pip install numpy
Run the notebook:
Open Numpy_practice.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute each cell to learn and understand the concept.
